                Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text
                used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is
                attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is
                thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum
                et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins
                with: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,

                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block
                of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract
                from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out
                pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the
                focus is meant to be on design, not content. The passage
                experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset
                used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s
                as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software.
                Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and
                stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for
                the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.
